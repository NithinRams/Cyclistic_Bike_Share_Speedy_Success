# GDA_Cyclistic
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. The bicycle hire company has two categories of customers — casual riders — they utilize Cyclistic’s bikes on a one-off or short-term basis, and members — are subscribed to the annual riders’ plan.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From the insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

There are 3 pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as Casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
